It detects correctness issues, such as code bugs and faulty hardware, early and pinpoints their root cause. TrainCheck has detected silent errors in a wide range of real-world training scenarios, from large-scale LLM pretraining (such as BLOOM-176B) to small-scale tutorial runs by deep learning beginners. \ud83d\udccc For a list of successful cases, see our Success Stories . What It Does TrainCheck uses training invariants , which are semantic rules that describe expected behavior during training, to detect bugs as they happen. These invariants can be extracted from any correct run, including those produced by official examples and tutorials. There is no need to curate inputs or write manual assertions. TrainCheck performs three core functions: Instruments your training code Inserts lightweight tracing into existing scripts (such as pytorch/examples or transformers ) with minimal code changes. Learns invariants from correct runs Discovers expected relationships across APIs, tensors, and training steps to build a model of normal behavior. Checks new or modified runs Validates behavior against the learned invariants and flags silent errors, such as missing gradient clipping, weight desynchronization, or broken mixed precision, right when they occur. This picture illustrates the TrainCheck workflow: Under the hood, TrainCheck decomposes into three CLI tools: - Instrumentor ( traincheck-collect ) Wraps target training programs with lightweight tracing logic. It produces an instrumented version of the target program that logs API calls and model states without altering training semantics. - Inference Engine ( traincheck-infer ) Consumes one or more trace logs from successful runs to infer training invariants. - Checker ( traincheck-check ) Runs alongside or after new training jobs to verify that each recorded event satisfies the inferred invariants. \ud83d\udd25 Try TrainCheck Work through 5\u2011Minute Experience with TrainCheck .

We\u2019ll refer to this buggy pipeline simply as '84911'. Estimated time : ~5 minutes (plus model/inference overhead) Prerequisites - A working TrainCheck installation - efficientnet_pytorch and torchvision (install via pip3 install efficientnet_pytorch torchvision ) - A Linux machine with a CUDA\u2011enabled GPU - \ud83d\udca1 Tip: If you don\u2019t have a CUDA GPU, you can still run this tutorial on CPU\u2014it\u2019ll just take longer. Background: What\u2019s wrong with 84911? The author attempts to finetune a pretrained EfficientNet_b0 model for image classification but notices that\u2014even after many epochs\u2014the training loss barely improves (x\u2011axis = epoch, y\u2011axis = loss): It appears from the plot that the model is still being trained, but somehow it is just not improving meaningfully. The original issue post discussed adjusting learning rate, and training for longer epochs. However, the issue remained unresolved. We have diagnosed the root cause for you. You can look at it now or come at it yourself with the help of TrainCheck. Click here to reveal the root cause. The developer, for some reason, sets `requires_grad` to `False` for all parameters except for batch normalization layers, yet only initializes the optimizer with the final fully-connected layer. for name,param in model_transfer.module.named_parameters(): if(\"bn\" not in name): param.requires_grad = False for param in model_transfer.module._fc.parameters(): param.requires_grad = False ... optimizer_transfer = optim.Adam(model_transfer.module._fc.parameters(), lr=0.001) This freeze logic leaves virtually no trainable parameters. Since batch normalization layers still update their running mean/variance each forward pass, the loss/accuracy curves drift slightly instead of remaining flat\u2014masking the lack of actual learning. Logging metrics only once per epoch further hides the anomalies, so the initialization bug only becomes apparent after several epochs have already run. Detecting & Diagnosing 84911 We will infer invariants from the mnist.py, a very simple PyTorch-official pipeline that trains a 2-layer CNN on MNIST, to showcase TrainCheck's capability. 1. Download example scripts cd ~ mkdir traincheck-tutorial && cd traincheck-tutorial wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrderLab/traincheck/main/docs/assets/code/mnist.py wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrderLab/traincheck/main/docs/assets/code/84911.py \ud83d\udca1 If the wget links above fail (e.g. due to branch changes or access issues), you can also download the files manually from: - mnist.py - 84911.py 2. Instrument & collect trace from mnist.py (~1 minute) traincheck-collect \\ --pyscript mnist.py \\ --models-to-track model \\ --output-dir traincheck_mnist_trace This instruments torch and model in mnist.py , runs it with default arguments, and writes JSON trace files into traincheck_mnist_trace/ (\u2248 1 minute). You\u2019ll see the training logs and any benign PyTorch warnings on stdout. 3. Infer Invariants from mnist.py (~1-4 minutes) We will infer invariants from the trace we just collected using the command below. traincheck-infer -f ./traincheck_mnist_trace This will produce an invariants.json file (one JSON Line per invariant). Verify the count: wc -l invariants.json # should output ~913 The generated invariants capture API invocation order, event expectations, and input-output relationships. Since the trace comes from a single, simple script, some invariants may overfit\u2014we\u2019ll cover filtering in the next steps. 4. Check for silent issues in 84911.py with invariants (~5-10 minutes) Note : For this quickstart, we do offline checking for simplicity. # trace the buggy pipeline (~5 minutes) traincheck-collect \\ --pyscript 84911.py \\ --models-to-track model_transfer \\ --output-dir traincheck_84911_trace # run the checker (~2\u20136 minutes) traincheck-check \\ --trace-folders traincheck_84911_trace \\ --invariants invariants.json The output of the traincheck-check command will contain this in the end: Checking finished. 913 invariants checked Total failed invariants: 25/913 Total passed invariants: 888/913 # number here includes both passed and not triggered invariants Total invariants that are not triggered: 552/913 361 invariants were checked on 84911.py , and 25 got violated. The checker writes the full results to a folder named traincheck_checker_results_<timestamp> , containing the results ( failed.log , not_triggered.log , passed.log , depending if an invariant is violated, not checked at all, or checked and passed.), and a copy of invariants.json . 5. Detection & Diagnosis Ready to play detective? \ud83d\udd0d TrainCheck flagged 25 invariant violations right at the start of training\u2014well before the fluctuating loss/accuracy pattern was observed. Let\u2019s interpret the results first and then if you want to learn more. 1. Quick filter - Event\u2011order invariants noise (20/25 failures): - FunctionCoverRelation and FunctionLeadRelation invariants (basically specifying API invocation orders) overfit our single demo trace. - Examples: strict ordering of torch.distributed.is_initialized (6 invariants violated but we are not even doing distributed training in 84911!) or torch.cuda.is_initialized (another 7 invariants violated but shouldn't matter at all for training). - Ignore these . 2. Spot the real issues - APIContainRelation invariant violations (5/25): 1. Optimizer.zero_grad did not reset .grad from non-zero to zero/None. - Implies either no gradients were ever populated or zeroing silently failed. 2. Adadelta.step did not update .data of any parameters. - Indicates the optimizer had no trainable parameters to touch. \ud83e\udde9 Putting it all together: The optimizer wasn\u2019t updating anything because\u2026 the parameters it received had requires_grad=False. Go to Background: What\u2019s wrong in 84911? to see the full root cause confirmed and explained. \ud83d\ude4b Click here to learn how to inspect the raw results Open the `failed_*.log` file\u2014TrainCheck writes each violated invariant as a standalone JSON object. For example: { \"invariant\": { \u2026 }, \"check_passed\": false, \"triggered\": true, \"detection_time\": 18343040207314524, \"detection_time_percentage\": 0.1805434802294184, \"trace\": [ { \"func_call_id\": \"...\", \"meta_vars.step\": 1, \"function\": \"torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad\", \u2026 } ... ] } - `\"invariant\"` shows the invariant that this result correspond to, and - `\"trace\"` corresponds to the specific trace that caused the violation. - `\"check_passed\": false` means that the invariant has been violated. - `\"triggered\": true` means that the invariant has been checked at least once, which is always the case if the invariant is violated. - `\"detection_time\"` is the timestamp when the violation happened. - `\"detection_percentage\"` is the percentage of this timestamp in the entire duration of the training, and gives a rough impression of how early the detection is. We are working on providing a field `\"detection_step\"` that pinpoints on which step the issue is detected. For now, to get \"step\", you can look at the `\"trace\"` field and look for step numbers in `\"meta_vars\"`. For example, the \"`optimizer.zero_grad` did **not** reset `.grad` from non-zero to zero/None\" is represented as: { \"invariant\": { \"relation\": \"APIContainRelation\", \"params\": [ { \"param_type\": \"APIParam\", \"api_full_name\": \"torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad\" }, { \"param_type\": \"VarTypeParam\", \"var_type\": \"torch.nn.Parameter\", \"attr_name\": \"grad\", \"pre_value\": \"non_zero\", \"post_value\": null } ], \"precondition\": { \"parent_func_call_pre\": { \"inverted\": true, \"preconditions\": [ { \"clauses\": [ { \"type\": \"constant\", \"prop_name\": \"meta_vars.step\", \"additional_path\": \"None\", \"prop_dtype\": \"int\", \"values\": [ 0 ] } ] }, { \"clauses\": [ { \"type\": \"constant\", \"prop_name\": \"meta_vars.stage\", \"additional_path\": \"None\", \"prop_dtype\": \"str\", \"values\": [ \"testing\", \"init\" ] } ] } ] } }, \"num_positive_examples\": 20, \"num_negative_examples\": 1 }, \"check_passed\": false, \"triggered\": true, \"detection_time\": 18343039144178123, \"detection_time_percentage\": 0.16245728748900484, \"trace\": [ { \"func_call_id\": \"3f7265b362c34725b412cf693ceea8f3_18343039144122325\", \"thread_id\": 140156043466560, \"process_id\": 1263911, \"meta_vars.step\": 1, \"type\": \"function_call (pre)\", \"function\": \"torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad\", \"is_bound_method\": true, \"obj_id\": 140152527083248, \"args\": { \"0\": { \"torch.optim.adadelta.Adadelta\": {} } }, \"kwargs\": {}, \"time\": 18343039144178123, \"return_values\": NaN, \"var_name\": NaN, \"var_type\": NaN, \"mode\": NaN, \"dump_loc\": NaN, \"attributes._ML_DAIKON_data_ID\": NaN, \"attributes.data\": NaN, \"attributes.dtype\": NaN, \"attributes.grad\": NaN, \"attributes.grad_fn\": NaN, \"attributes.is_cpu\": NaN, \"attributes.is_cuda\": NaN, \"attributes.is_ipu\": NaN, \"attributes.is_leaf\": NaN, \"attributes.is_meta\": NaN, \"attributes.is_mkldnn\": NaN, \"attributes.is_mps\": NaN, \"attributes.is_mtia\": NaN, \"attributes.is_nested\": NaN, \"attributes.is_ort\": NaN, \"attributes.is_quantized\": NaN, \"attributes.is_sparse\": NaN, \"attributes.is_sparse_csr\": NaN, \"attributes.is_vulkan\": NaN, \"attributes.is_xla\": NaN, \"attributes.is_xpu\": NaN, \"attributes.itemsize\": NaN, \"attributes.name\": NaN, \"attributes.nbytes\": NaN, \"attributes.ndim\": NaN, \"attributes.requires_grad\": NaN, \"attributes.retains_grad\": NaN, \"attributes.shape\": NaN, \"attributes._ML_DAIKON_grad_ID\": NaN, \"exception\": NaN, \"exception_msg\": NaN, \"proxy_obj_names\": NaN } ] } The invariant specifies that `torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad` (*the first invariant parameter*) invocations must change `.grad` from a non-zero value to `null` (*the second invariant parameter*), except during the very first iteration (*i.e. before any backward pass when no `.grad` exists, as per the invariant precondition*). We then inspect the trace record where the invariant is violated: `meta_vars.step` is 1, indicating detection occurred in the second training iteration. You can review the other results in the same way. The `NaN` values denote missing fields and can be safely ignored. \ud83c\udf89 You just used TrainCheck to catch a real-world silent bug before it impacted training!","title":"5 Minute Quick Start"},{"location":"5-min-tutorial/#quick-start-traincheck-tutorial","text":"In this tutorial, you will use TrainCheck to detect & diagnose the real\u2011world silent issue in PyTorch\u2011Forum\u201184911: Obtaining abnormal changes in loss and accuracy , with invariants inferred from PyTorch\u2019s official MNIST example.

For such cases\u2014and for bugs that share the same root cause/manifest\u2014we may provide a shared/simulated trace and a shared invariant that is reused across multiple bug IDs. \ud83e\uddea Reproducing Silent Issue Detection All steps described below assumes you are already in the TrainCheck-Evaluation-Workloads repo.

TrainCheck Installation Guide \u2014 Step-by-step instructions for setting up TrainCheck. Technical Usage Guide \u2014 Detailed documentation on how to use TrainCheck, configure instrumentation, and interpret outputs. Evaluation Workloads Repository \u2014 Contains all evaluation workloads and automation scripts used in the experiments. Overview TrainCheck is an invariant-based tool for detecting silent correctness issues in PyTorch training pipelines. This artifact enables reproduction of the four main evaluation results from the paper: Silent Issue Detection (Section 5.1) Invariant Transferability (Section 5.3) False Positive Rate (Section 5.4) Performance Overhead (Section 5.5) To get familiar with TrainCheck, we recommend starting with the 5-Minute Tutorial , which walks you through detecting a real-world bug from Section 5.1. \u23f1\ufe0f Recommended Evaluation Order We suggest running the evaluations in the following order, based on automation level and runtime requirements: Kick the tires \u2013 5 min tutorial with TrainCheck Performance Overhead (~10 minutes) False Positive Rate (~1.5 hours) Transferability (~30 minutes) Silent Issue Detection (~ variate, should be able to finish within one day) Environment Requirements Many of our experiment scripts are written in xonsh, a shell that combines Python and Bash.

These invariants are used to define the expected behavior of a training pipeline, and later help detect silent issues when applied to other runs. Each invariant describes a specific pattern of behavior observed in the trace, such as: - Attribute changes during a function call (e.g., .grad becomes None in zero_grad() ) - Ordering relationships between API calls (e.g., zero_grad() should occur before step() ) - Consistency among values across different parameters (e.g., shared parameters should have the same value across devices during distributed training) Invariant Representation An invariant is defined by three things: 1. relation : the relationship this invariant encodes, can be viewed as an invariant template. Each relation has a separate inference algorithm defined (e.g., ConsistencyRelation.infer ) 2. params : descriptors for entities that should obey the relationship. 3. precondition : a logical predicate defining the context when an invariant can be applied. In the actual json representation of invariants in the traincheck-infer output, an invariant looks like this. { \"text_description\": \"torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad contains VarChangeEvent torch.nn.Parameter, pre_value: non_zero, post_value: None\", \"relation\": \"APIContainRelation\", \"params\": [ { \"param_type\": \"APIParam\", \"api_full_name\": \"torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad\" }, { \"param_type\": \"VarTypeParam\", \"var_type\": \"torch.nn.Parameter\", \"attr_name\": \"grad\", \"pre_value\": \"non_zero\", \"post_value\": null } ], \"precondition\": { \"parent_func_call_pre\": { \"inverted\": true, \"preconditions\": [ { \"clauses\": [ { \"type\": \"constant\", \"prop_name\": \"meta_vars.step\", \"additional_path\": \"None\", \"prop_dtype\": \"int\", \"values\": [ 0 ] } ] }, { \"clauses\": [ { \"type\": \"constant\", \"prop_name\": \"meta_vars.stage\", \"additional_path\": \"None\", \"prop_dtype\": \"str\", \"values\": [ \"init\", \"testing\" ] } ] } ] } }, \"num_positive_examples\": 200, \"num_negative_examples\": 1 } This invariant encodes the expectation that calling torch.optim.optimizer.Optimizer.zero_grad() should reset gradients \u2014 that is, the .grad attribute of torch.nn.Parameter objects should transition from a non-zero value to null (i.e., None or missing). - text_description: A human-readable summary of the invariant. > Note: This field is generated using a best-effort strategy and may not fully reflect the invariant\u2019s semantics. In some cases, it may be missing or incomplete. \ud83d\udcc6 We are planning to further formalize this field in the future. relation: \"APIContainRelation\" An event is expected to happen within the duration of an API invocation. params: An API call: zero_grad() on a PyTorch optimizer An attribute: .grad on a torch.nn.Parameter , which should change from a non-zero value ( \"pre_value\": \"non_zero\" ) to null ( \"post_value\": null ) during the call precondition: This invariant only applies outside the following contexts: The first step of training ( meta_vars.step == 0 ) The init or testing stages ( meta_vars.stage in {\"init\", \"testing\"} ) These are specified as inverted preconditions, meaning the invariant does not apply during those times (e.g., it\u2019s okay to not clear .grad on the first step when nothing has been backpropagated yet). num_positive_examples: 20 This behavior was observed and confirmed 200 times in the reference traces. num_negative_examples: 1 The invariant failed once \u2014 in this case, during the first training iteration, when .grad had not yet been populated before the zero_grad() call. > \ud83c\udfaf This behavior is expected and correctly handled by the precondition, which excludes step 0. Invariant Inference Workflow At a high level, TrainCheck performs invariant inference in three stages: Hypothesis Generation For each supported relation type, TrainCheck scans the provided traces and generates hypotheses by identifying patterns where a potential invariant could exist (i.e., when matching examples are observed). Example Collection For every hypothesis, TrainCheck performs a full scan across all provided traces to gather positive examples (where the hypothesized invariant holds) and negative examples (where it does not). Precondition Deduction TrainCheck analyzes the collected examples to infer a distinguishing predicate\u2014a logical condition that holds true for all positive examples and false for negative ones. This predicate becomes the invariant\u2019s precondition, reducing false positives during checking. \u2699\ufe0f For full details on the inference algorithms, please refer to our OSDI\u201925 paper (documentation is in progress). \ud83e\uddea Practical Guidelines: Choosing Input Pipelines When selecting input pipelines for invariant inference, there are two main considerations: Representativeness You want your input pipelines to be diverse enough to infer a representative set of invariants. This helps: - Avoid overfitting to specific patterns. - Ensure that inferred invariants and preconditions remain accurate across varying scenarios. For example, if none of your input pipelines use mixed precision, TrainCheck might infer invariants like: \"For mathematical operations, the output dtype must equal the input dtype.\" However, if mixed precision pipelines are included, TrainCheck will refine such invariants by adding preconditions like: \"This applies only when a torch.autocast context manager is not active.\" \u26a1 How many pipelines should you include? It depends on how different your target pipeline is from available reference pipelines: - If the target is a minor variant of a known-good pipeline, using just that reference may suffice. - If the target pipeline introduces new frameworks, tasks, or architectures, include a broader set of inputs to improve generalization. Inference Time Inference time is generally not a major concern, since inference happens offline. However, due to the repetitive nature of training loops, you can safely shorten reference runs without sacrificing invariant quality. In practice: - For all bugs detected by TrainCheck so far, we limited inference traces to at most 100 iterations. - Shortened runs have shown no significant impact on the usefulness or accuracy of inferred invariants. Core Principles \u2013 A Summary Focus on the diversity of input traces \u2014 capturing different configurations, behaviors, or modes of operation. The length or size of traces matters far less. Efficient inference is achievable with short, representative runs. Implementation Limitations TrainCheck operates on large traces with a dynamic schema, where variable types and fields can change over time. This, combined with the need for cross-trace comparisons, limits the use of typical data storage solutions like SQL databases or optimized DataFrame libraries (e.g., Polars), which require fixed schemas. To handle this, we use in-process Pandas DataFrames backed by NumPy. While effective, this approach is currently single-threaded due to Python\u2019s GIL, leaving room for future performance improvements. We are exploring options such as shared-memory DataFrames, schema standardization, or schemaless databases (e.g., MongoDB) if data transmission overhead proves manageable. Note: While data sharding could improve parallelism, it would overcomplicate cross-trace and cross-time analysis and is better handled at the storage layer rather than within inference logic.","title":"Invariant Inference &amp; Representation"},{"location":"infer/#invariant-inference-representation","text":"traincheck-infer is part of the inference stage of the TrainCheck workflow.

TrainCheck is designed to be minimally intrusive\u2014requiring no code modifications or rewrites of training logic. \ud83d\udd27 System Overview TrainCheck consists of three core command-line utilities: traincheck-collect \u2013 Instruments a training pipeline and collects trace logs. traincheck-infer \u2013 Infers behavioral invariants from the collected traces. traincheck-check \u2013 Checks new traces against a set of inferred invariants to detect silent issues. TrainCheck workflows are organized into two stages: \ud83e\uddea Inference Stage traincheck-collect collects execution traces from reference training pipelines. traincheck-infer analyzes traces and produces invariants that describe correct/expected runtime behavior. \ud83d\udea8 Checking Stage traincheck-collect is used again to trace the target (possibly buggy) pipeline. traincheck-check verifies whether the collected trace violates any of the known invariants. \ud83d\udce6 Pre-Inferred Invariants (On the Roadmap) In common use cases, users typically do not need to infer invariants manually.

If you have a past run of the same code that worked well, just use that. You can also use small-scale example pipelines that cover different features of the framework (e.g., various optimizers, mixed precision, optional flags).
